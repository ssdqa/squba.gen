Description: These general-use functions are intended to support the use of each of the distinct modules
    that are part of the Study-Specific Data Quality Analysis (SSDQA) ecosystem. While they work best used 
    in conjunction with the SSDQA modules and are typically executed as part of larger summary functions,
    these operations can be run independently against data in the proper formatting. They are also needed
    if a multi-site analysis is desired but site data is stored independently. For more information on how
    to use the functions in this package to that end, please see the 
    "Multi-Site Analysis for Independent Data Sources" vignette included in the SSDQA module of interest (where applicable).
