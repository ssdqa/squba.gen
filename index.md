# squba.gen

The `squba.gen` package contains an array of support functions used in
each of the modules throughout the `squba` ecosystem. These range from
color palettes used in data visualizations to the anomaly detection
methods that drive many computations. While these functions are intended
to be used within `squba` modules or applied to those results, they can
be used in other contexts when input data meets the appropriate
criteria.

## Installation

You can install the development version of squba.gen like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('ssdqa/squba.gen')
```
