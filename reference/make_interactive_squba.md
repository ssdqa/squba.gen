# Make `squba` outputs interactive

This function converts a ggplot object output by any of the \*\_output
functions into an interactive ggiraph or plotly object.

## Usage

``` r
make_interactive_squba(ggplot_obj)
```

## Arguments

- ggplot_obj:

  *ggplot* \|\| **required**

  A ggplot object output by any of the `*_output` functions native to
  each module. This will only work with graphs generated by `squba`, as
  it adds some additional metadata to each plot that is required for
  this function to work.

## Value

The same graph with interactive functionality and pre-set tooltips based
either in the `ggiraph` package or the `plotly` package
